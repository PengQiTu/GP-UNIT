For easy training, the dataset is suggested to be arranged following the folder structures:

```
DatasetName
|--train
   |--ClassName1
      <training images>
   |--ClassName2
      <training images>
   ...
   |--ClassNameN
      <training images>   
|--test (or val)
   |--ClassName1
      <testing images>
   |--ClassName2
      <testing images>
   ...
   |--ClassNameN
      <testing images>   
```
